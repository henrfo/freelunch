# FreeLunch - Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict Equinor stock movements. It serves as a playground for learning how to work with complex, noisy financial data and understanding temporal patterns in market behavior.

## Motivation

Financial markets present one of the most challenging domains for predictive modeling due to their inherently noisy nature, non-stationary distributions, and complex temporal dependencies. This project aims to:

- Experiment with various ML approaches for time series forecasting
- Understand the limitations and possibilities of stock prediction
- Learn to handle noisy, real-world data with temporal patterns
- Explore feature engineering techniques for financial data

## Project Structure

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that implement different approaches to stock prediction, focusing on:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Sequence modeling for temporal patterns
- Model training and validation strategies
- Performance analysis and visualization

## Technical Approach

The project utilizes deep learning and traditional machine learning methods to capture patterns in historical stock data, including:
- Time series analysis
- Sequential modeling
- Feature extraction from market indicators

## Disclaimer

This project is purely educational and experimental. It is designed for learning purposes and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Financial markets are inherently unpredictable, and past performance does not guarantee future results.

## Goals

- Learn to work with noisy, real-world financial data
- Understand temporal dependencies in time series
- Experiment with different ML architectures
- Develop robust validation strategies for financial models

## Note

Remember: if there was a reliable way to predict the stock market, everyone would be doing it. This project is about the journey of learning, not finding a "free lunch" in the markets!
